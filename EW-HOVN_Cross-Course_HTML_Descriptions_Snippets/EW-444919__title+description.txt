🚨 BLS Challenge – Assessment-Only Option for Experienced Providers

 
This is an assessment-only session—an American Red Cross BLS Challenge—designed for experienced providers who need to renew their certification. There is no instruction or remediation during this session.
 

🔥 IMPORTANT:

You must demonstrate all BLS skills and pass a written test to earn certification.
This is not a training course. You must already know the skills like the back of your hand.
If you fail the Challenge, you will not be certified and must complete the full BLS course at a later date.


💡 We strongly recommend that you purchase the ARC BLS Provider Manual (or use reliable online resources) to review and practice before attempting the Challenge. There are also non-endorsed YouTube videos that can help—search for "ARC BLS skills demonstration" for reference.
 

⚠️ No refunds for Challenge failures.
 

Confidence is key. Know it, show it, and get certified!
