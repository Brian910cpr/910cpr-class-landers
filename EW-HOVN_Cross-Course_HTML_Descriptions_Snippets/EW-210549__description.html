AHA BLS Provider – Heartcode (Blended Learning)



The American Heart Association (AHA) Heartcode BLS course uses a blended learning format that includes an interactive online course followed by an in-person skills session. This format is ideal for healthcare professionals who need flexibility without compromising the required hands-on components of CPR training.



Participants complete the online Heartcode BLS Provider course at their own pace and then attend a scheduled in-person skills session with an AHA Instructor. This allows for independent review followed by personalized feedback and evaluation of CPR skills.

Course Highlights:

Complete the Heartcode BLS online course independently
Attend a 30–60 minute in-person skills session
Receive instructor feedback and hands-on practice
Demonstrate proficiency in high-quality CPR and AED use
Earn a two-year AHA BLS Provider eCard upon successful completion


Course Options:

Heartcode BLS Access Code: Must be completed prior to the skills session. Course available at shopcpr.heart.org.
Add-on Option: Heartsaver First Aid skills testing available during your appointment. Great for students or workplaces that require both CPR and First Aid certification.


Important: Please email your AHA Heartcode BLS completion certificate to info@910cpr.com or bring a printed copy to your skills session. Completion is required for participation and eCard issuance.

** The AHA Heartcode course link is non-refundable once issued. **

Cancellation Policy: You may reschedule your in-person session once with 48-hour notice. The AHA BLS Provider eCard is issued the same day as successful skills completion.
