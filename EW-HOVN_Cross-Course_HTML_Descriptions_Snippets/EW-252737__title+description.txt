The Family & Friends CPR course is intended for anyone who wants to learn CPR and prefers to learn in 
an Instructor-led or facilitated group environment. This course is for people who do not need a course completion card for a job or other requirements.
The course is ideal for parents, grandparents, caregivers, school groups and students, and others interested in learning how to save a life. Skills are taught using American Heart Association's research-proven practice-while-watching technique, which allows participants to practice on a CPR training manikin while skills are demonstrated in the course video.
