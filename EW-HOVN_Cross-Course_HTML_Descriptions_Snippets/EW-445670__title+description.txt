HSI BLS and Adult First Aid – Blended Learning



This HSI blended learning course combines Basic Life Support (BLS) and Adult First Aid/CPR/AED into a single certification. It's perfect for workplaces that need both credentials to meet insurance or licensing requirements. Participants complete an online course and then attend a brief in-person skills session with an authorized HSI instructor.
 


 

Once registered, students receive a link to the online portion, which covers adult CPR, AED use, First Aid basics, and professional-level BLS topics such as team response, airway support, and high-performance compressions. After completing the online section, students attend a short in-person session to demonstrate hands-on skills and receive real-time feedback.

Course Highlights:

One card covers both Adult First Aid and BLS
Ideal for professional offices, medical/dental staff, and facilities requiring dual compliance
Complete the online course at your own pace
Attend a 30–60 minute in-person skills session
Earn a two-year HSI certification upon successful completion


This little-known 'combo' class was hiding in plain sight— but, it was exactly what a local ABA center needed and didn’t know existed. They were facing a $120+ per person AHA combo (Heartcode BLS + Heartsaver First Aid + skills session) just to meet TRICARE and TRILLIUM requirements. We helped them uncover this streamlined HSI alternative — and now it’s available for others in the same spot.
 
Course Options:

HSI Blended Course Link: Provided after registration. Must be completed prior to your scheduled skills session.
Group Option: Onsite training and flexible scheduling available for businesses or organizations with 5 or more participants.


Important: Please complete the HSI online course before attending your scheduled skills session. You will need to show proof of completion at the time of your appointment.

** The HSI blended course link is non-refundable once issued. **

Cancellation Policy: You may reschedule your in-person session once with 48-hour notice. Your HSI certification is issued the same day as successful skills completion.
 


Continuing Education Credit: Many HSI courses are eligible for CE credit through employer, EMS, or nursing boards. Contact your licensing authority for eligibility confirmation. HSI provides a downloadable completion record for documentation.
