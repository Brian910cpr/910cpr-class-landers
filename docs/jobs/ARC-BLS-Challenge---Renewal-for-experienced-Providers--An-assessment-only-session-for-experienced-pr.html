By combining online coursework with an in-person skills session, they allow you to learn at your own pace – and in the place, and on the device, you like best. Throughout the course, our interactive scenarios will help you understand the often-nuanced facets of pediatric care and will help improve your clinical decision-making skills. After completing the online portion of course, and passing the final written exam, you'll attend an in-person skills session where you'll demonstrate your PALS skills to a certified Red Cross instructor. Once you've passed both sections of the course, you'll receive a two-year Pediatric Advanced Life Support certification.</div></p><p></p></div><p></p>
